# History
Judaism didn't begin to branch until the 18th century

Christianity splits from Judaism in the first century

Islam splits from Christianity in the 7th century

In 632 CE, Sunni and Shia Islam split because of disagreements over who would be Muhammad's successor

In 1844, Ali Muhammad Shirazi founds Bábism from the Twelvers sub-denomination of Shia Islam

During the 19th century, the Baháʼí Faith developed from Bábism
