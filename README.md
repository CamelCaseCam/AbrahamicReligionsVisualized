# History
Judaism didn't begin to branch until the 18th century

Christianity splits from Judaism in the first century

In 1054, the East-West Schism (AKA the Great Schism) splits Christianity into Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy

In 1378, two popes were elected after the death of Pope Gregory XI. In 1409, a third Pisan pope was elected, further complicating the issue

In 1534, King Henry VIII creates the Church of England so he can divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon
