# History
Judaism didn't begin to branch until the 18th century

In the late 18th century to early 19th century, Reform Judaism splits from Orthodox Judaism

In 1887, Conservative Judaism is founded in response to Reform Judaism. Conservative Judaism lies in the middle ground between Reform and Orthodox Judaism, following for the most part the traditional Jewish laws but making some changes to accomodate modern life.
