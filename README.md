# History
Judaism didn't begin to branch until the 18th century

Christianity splits from Judaism in the first century

Islam splits from Christianity in the 7th century

In 632 CE, Sunni and Shia Islam split because of disagreements over who would be Muhammad's successor

In July 657, Kharijite Islam splits from Shia Islam when Ali ibn Abi Talib agrees to arbitration with his rival over who would become the next caliph

While Ibadi Islam evolved from Kharijite Islam, they are far more moderate and are considered distinct
