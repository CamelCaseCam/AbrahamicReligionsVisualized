I'm visualizing all the major abrahamic religions using github's branches.


# History
Judaism didn't begin to branch until the 18th century

Christianity splits from Judaism in the first century

In 1054, the East-West Schism (AKA the Great Schism) splits Christianity into Western Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy
